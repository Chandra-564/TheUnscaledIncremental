All who have researched it have eventually died the same way, so it is impossible to tell exactly, but this is the common belief. Regardless, with the introduction of 'cancer' mode, as well as reports of it's spontaneous appearance, sufficient repetition of this mode's appearance may lead to  an image forming in the mind similar to 'Fractal Cancer Type III'.
